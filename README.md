Data types and descriptions of each attribute: 

City (string) : These are a list of all the cities in India, some cities were deleted because of missing data from the population columns made the data for thsoe cities useless. 
2001 Population (float): This is the population recorded for cities in India in 2001. 
2011 Population (float): This is the population recorded for cities in India in 2001.
Change in Population (float): This is the difference in the population from 2011 to 2001. I calculated this data from the two other population data. 

Potential Issues and Biases: India is full of rural towns which can be hard to reach and hard to accuratley estimate the population.
